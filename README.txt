This is the main project hub for METAbolt and the METAbolt Development Team.



All bugs, enhancement and issues need to go into the Issues section.



If you have Read Only access to this repo you need to note the below steps to work in sync with the project:



1. Fork the METAbolt project to do the work you need to do

2. Submit your project/patch using the upload utility (https://bitbucket.org/LLuke/metabolt/downloads) and inform Legolas Luke




To get the live source code you have 2 options:



1. Use HG (Source tab)

2. Use the Download tab to download in ZIP, gz or bz2 file formats

If you use HG (recommended) I would recommend TortoiseHG (http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/)
